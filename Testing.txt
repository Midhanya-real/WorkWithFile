This summer I was in Greece.This country is beautiful.I swam in sea with my family.The sea was very big-I love it.One day I saw a boy,who couldn't swim!But he was eighteen years old.I thought it was very strange.We lived in the coolest hotel in the Greece-"Independence".It was five star hotel.I liked sunbathing and swimming-it's my favorite hobby.
